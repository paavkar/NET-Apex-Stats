# NET-Apex-Stats

This is an updated version of my older app. This version has a changed state management with Redux Toolkit and instead of using browser's local storage, redux persist is used. The frontend is improved in other aspects as well.
The app is available at https://apex-stats.azurewebsites.net/.
